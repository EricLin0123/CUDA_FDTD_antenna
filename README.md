# Patch Antenna FDTD Simulation with CUDA acceleration

by 林萬荃

## Description

This project is a CUDA-accelerated FDTD simulation of a patch antenna. The simulation is based on the paper by Sheen et al. [1]. The original code is written in C++ and is available from [Pete Bevelacqua's website](https://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/patches/patch6.php) [2]. The original code is modified to use CUDA for acceleration.
